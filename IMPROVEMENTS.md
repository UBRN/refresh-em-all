# Performance Improvements for Refresh-Em-All Extension

## Summary of Issues Addressed

The extension was experiencing performance issues and memory-related errors when processing large numbers of tabs. This was identified by the UUID `fbf7234f-c82b-4801-9981-5c5695a5633c`, which indicated an error related to Chrome extension API usage, likely due to excessive memory consumption or improper tab batch processing.

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Batch Processing

- Added dynamic batch size adjustment based on the total number of tabs
- Reduced batch size for larger tab counts (3 tabs for 50+ tabs, 4 tabs for 20+ tabs)
- Increased delay between batches for larger tab counts to reduce memory pressure

```javascript
// Reduce batch size for extremely large tab counts to prevent memory issues
const dynamicBatchSize = tabs.length > 50 ? 3 : (tabs.length > 20 ? 4 : MAX_TABS_PER_BATCH);
const dynamicBatchInterval = tabs.length > 50 ? 1000 : BATCH_INTERVAL; // Longer interval for more tabs
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling and Retry Logic

- Implemented exponential backoff for tab refresh retries
- Added more robust error handling for different tab states
- Improved handling of discarded tabs with more careful activation and refresh
- Added graceful handling of non-existent tabs

### 3. Memory Management

- Added explicit garbage collection hints after each batch (when available)
- Improved cleaning up of timeout references to prevent memory leaks
- Added operation ID tracking for better debugging and resource management

```javascript
// Memory management after each batch
if (typeof gc === 'function') {
    try {
        gc(); // Force garbage collection if available
    } catch (e) {
        // Ignore if not available
    }
}
```

### 4. Tab Handling Improvements

- Split tab refresh logic into specialized helper functions for better organization
- Added better handling of special URLs (like chrome:// pages and extension pages)
- Improved checking if tabs still exist before attempting to refresh them
- Added better handling of tab state preservation

### 5. Comprehensive Logging

- Added detailed console logging to aid in debugging
- Added operation tracking with unique UUIDs for each refresh operation
- Improved progress reporting in the UI

### 6. Improved Testing

- Enhanced detection of extension service workers in test scripts
- Updated all test scripts to better handle both Manifest V2 and V3 extensions
- Added a debug-extension script to diagnose extension loading issues
- Added UUID analyzer tools to help diagnose specific error scenarios

## Results

These improvements should lead to:

1. More reliable tab refreshing with fewer errors
2. Better handling of large numbers of tabs without crashing
3. Improved user experience with better progress reporting
4. Easier troubleshooting with more detailed logs and error reports

## Additional Tools Added

- `analyze-uuid` - Tool to analyze UUIDs found in error reports
- `analyze-stress` - Tool to analyze UUIDs found in stress test results
- `analyze-verification` - Tool to analyze UUIDs found in verification results
- `debug-extension` - Tool to debug extension loading issues
